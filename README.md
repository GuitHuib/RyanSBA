# Ryan's Demo site for PerScholas

This was created to fulfill specific criteria to demonstrate certain HTML/CSS/JS uses, without using modern frameworks or libraries such as Jekyll. It is also (loosely)optimized for mobile.

Below are the criteria and how they were met.

## HTML

### Have at least 3 pages, keep the grid system consistent as much as possible
The site contains a home page, an about page, and a subscription to a fake mailing list
### Use at least 10 different HTML tags
Yup
### Use HTML tables
Unfortunately, I did incluse a sample HTML table in the about page
### Implement at least two uses for forms
The dummy subscription for includes text, email, and dropdown select inputs
### Dropped Down Menu
The form includes a dropdown select, and the nav bar includes a dropdown menu for links
### Use web fonts
Several of the headers utilize alternatives fonts
### Use different types of content in the form of text, images, videos, and GIFs
Several images are included in pages, and a youtube video in embedded on the about page, though it will not display correctly in localhost

## CSS
### Inline, internal, and external styling
The site utilizes bootstrap layout, custom css in the main.css file, and an inline styling sample for the page header of the mailing list page
### Use five different CSS selectors
And then some
### Donâ€™t use too many fonts
Just 2
### Use colors that complement each other
Limited colors, but black header and footers, and a gray card for the form
### Use Flexbox (Optional)
I did not find a good spot to use flexbox, but bootstrap utilizes bootstrap

## Javascript
### External scripts
The site uses both a custom script.js file, and imports bootstraps js package
### Use variables, if statements, loops, at least one form of collections, functions/call back, and events.
I never found a good use for collections or loops, but variables, ifs, callbacks, and events are all utilized

### Use JQuery (Optional)
The script.js file uses several jQuery selectors
